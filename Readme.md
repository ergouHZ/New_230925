1.Introduction
The website I designed offers the service of web design, in the name of WDC, Web Design Consultancy. Since we are learning web design, that I aim to help the client to build the website they want. And this site focuses on giving the consultancy service based on hours value first, we have to figure out what is the objective of the customer.
And based on the assumption that we have a team of developers and cyber security experts that offer the service to clients who may want to build a start-ups and create their on websites.
The most difficult and also important part is the calculation. In the calculator page, I set two selection menu for user to choose the currency and the hourly plan rate. And there is also a blank user can fill the hours into it. After clicking the button, the total result will be shown. It’s actually readable and functional
But here is something about the images and content needs to be indicated, the main purpose of the project is to design a web structure based on the idea by our own, containing the CSS, JS and API stuff into the web design. So I suppose the content of the website does not really matter, I generated most of the content on the website by ChatGpt, and I put those in the [Concultancy Script.txt]. The html and CSS code are all written by myself based on the lectures we took last few weeks. Since we haven’t started learning the API at the moment I started design, some of the things I learned from YouTube, which I will put in the references, and some of the code is learned from ChatGpt, I will put those in the [Code generated by AI.txt]. Most of the images are googled from internet. Some of those used PPT is designed by myself.
PS. The free API key I am using is limited.... So only change the real-accessed API url (shown below) while the calculating function needs to be tested online. Otherwise it’s a good idea to test other elements by using the local database.
// const apiUrl = `https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/709b6a33ec5b5a011299d8ff/latest/${baseCurrency}`;
const apiUrl= 'Intro/Rate Data BackUp.txt';

2.layout and navigation.
2.1.Navigation bar and method
 Navigation bar is originally content written in the page like the example one, but I was not satisfied with that. Then I customized the button by mainly using “border-bottom” and “border-radius” to make it look more like a button. The whole Navbar is blue, and I adjusted the opacity and using “position:fixed” to make it keep on the top of the page. It looks more modern and fits the trend. And for the same reason I want the main function -- calculation to be specific, I set an icon for the calculator on the navigation bar
About how to change the content by clicking the navigation bar, firstly I thought about changing the content with ID by using fetch method. But then I realized it may work in VS code, still it’s not working while I just open it on the local browser. I have to open it in an environment with server so that I can use. Plus I want to upload it on the Github which platform can render the pages into non-dynamic website and use my own domain. So I decided to change the method by using JS code to change the display style in the container div. That is the method I learned from AI, and I put it in the AI code.text. Basically, the home page is display by default, and other page’s dives are “display: none”. Running the Loadpage() function will set all “display: none”, and the targeted one will only be display

2.2.Page and website structure

3.Design and Style choices 
3.1.Colour and image choices 
3.2.The calculation function
In the calculating section, the “submit” function is something I learned from w3 school, and triggering the “calculateFee” function. But the out come will flash through, I didn’t realize it will be back to the default page by using submit method. So I change it into a “button”
